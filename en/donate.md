Currently **11**/15 Missions in 2017 are funded.

Our only sources of funding are [private donations](/faq#17_Why_do_we_accept_private_donations_only_).  
It is the work of many that we were able to rescue 6500 people last year. Every donation helps us to carry on with our rescue missions and to do what's necessary to stop the dying on the Mediterranean.

With ongoing donations you can support us monthly, quarterly, 
semi-annualy or annualy. Ongoing donations help us planning rescue missions more confidentely. Ongoing donations do not have to be of high volume. You decide whether you want to give 10 € or 100 €.  
Ongoing donations are provided via Betterplace. They end either when you end them or when we close the [project](/betterplace) for donations.
