**THE SECOND MISSION 2017**

**We demand a state-run rescue mission, Frau von der Leyen!**  
Since the beginning of mission Sophia ships of the navy are chasing a phantom - smugglers on the Mediterranean.  
Instead of using the 42.3 million Euros to rescue people in maritime distress the navy's ships are not allowed to engage in active search and rescue. We are forced to take responsibility on sea in place of politicians instead!  
In 2015 Frau von der Leyen claimed to sent those ships on a mission of search and rescue near the territorial waters of Libya. A mandate to fight against smugglers is the only thing that's left of that promise. There is no appearence of the word 'rescue' in that mandate. For the next two weeks we'll make your words come true and carry out rescue missions.

## Mission Procedure

Having discovered a boat in distress either by active search or on direction by a rescue coordination centre, the Iuventa remains at an appropriate stand off distance while the RHIBs approach the stricken boat from the stern and distribute life vets, if necessary.

One of the RHIBS starts then to shuttle persons to safety on board the Iuventa while the other always remains in contact with the boat. On occasion the RHIBS tow the boat alongside the Iuventa for direct embarkation.

Once on board, rescued persons receive medical attention and most importantly drinking water which is kept in large built-in tanks that can be refilled by generating potable water from sea water by means of a water-maker.  

Eventually larger NGO or Italian  coast-guard vessels transfer our rescued persons to safety ashore.

### Mission De Maizière

![Mission De Maizière background](../f/images/new/mission_current.jpg)

**FIRST MISSION 2017**

As young Europeans we take over the job of political actors who actually should take responsibility on the grounds of European values. We cannot watch any longer how Europes responsibilities are neglected on the borders of a Fortress Europe.  
We are investing our time and energy unsalaried to stand for our vision of Europe. When people die at our borders there is only one thing we should do: rescue them.

We're asking ourselves: If we manage to buy a ship, to convert it and to organise a professional crew to save people in maritime distress - why are political decision makers not able to take over those tasks?

From now on we will dedicate our rescue missions to exactly those persons whose responsibilities we are taking over on the sea.  
This is why our first mission will be dedicated to **Thomas De Maizière**.
