## Mission Procedure

Having discovered a boat in distress either by active search or on direction by a rescue coordination centre, the Iuventa remains at an appropriate stand off distance while the RHIBs approach the stricken boat from the stern and distribute life vets, if necessary.

One of the RHIBS starts then to shuttle persons to safety on board the Iuventa while the other always remains in contact with the boat. On occassion the RHIBS tow the boat alongside the Iuventa for direct embarkation.

Once on board, rescued persons receive medical attention and most importantly drinking water which is kept in large built-in tanks that can be refilled by generating potable water from sea water by means of a water-maker.  

Eventually larger NGO or Italian  coast-guard vessels transfer our rescued persons to safety ashore.
