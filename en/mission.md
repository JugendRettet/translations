**THE THIRD MISSION 2017**

**Acknowledge the distress of the people, Herr Kurz**  
Only in March did you say that the "NGO madness" in the Mediterranean must be end. We would also be pleased if our work became no longer necessary. But not like this!
Because you do not want to recognize the people's need and prefer to see an isolated Europe, we act where you do not. And so we name our mission after you!

Since the beginning of our project we have been criticizing the fact that private initiatives have to take over the task of sea rescue. Unfortunately, there are no measures by the state to counteract the suffering and distress of the fleeing people: There are neither comprehensive state marine rescue programs, nor measures to counteract the illegal immigration.
Instead, the EU governments are trying to create disgrace on the Mediterranean from the viewpoint of the European Community. The North African detention center and the development of the European frontier system will not put an end to the plight of the people and solve the problem. This has already been proved by the demands on the refugees of the Australian model in camps outside the EU.

The closure of the Balkan route, which you have so diligently worked on, is a symbol of the fact that such policies are completely unsuitable. The procedure, which you also call a success, simply ensured that the escape routes have shifted, and now several thousand refugees are stuck in Greece. The closure has neither led to an improvement for these people, nor has it had a positive effect on the migration movement.
Now you are promoting the closure of the Mediterranean route. And also a Europe without migration, without empathy and without moral consciousness.
Australia is detaining refugees in unsafe housing on secluded islands. Human rights organizations regularly report violent attacks, rape and abuse of children in these camps. Is this to be a serious example of European asylum policy?

You complain that the NGOs in the Mediterranean are the partners of the traffickers. Because on the basis of missing alternatives, refugees are only forced to entrust their life to traffickers. Maybe you should think about this chain, instead of pushing the blame on the organizations that keep people from drowning.

Sincerely,

Your Jugend Rettet Team

## Mission Procedure

Having discovered a boat in distress either by active search or on direction by a rescue coordination centre, the Iuventa remains at an appropriate stand off distance while the RHIBs approach the stricken boat from the stern and distribute life vets, if necessary.

One of the RHIBS starts then to shuttle persons to safety on board the Iuventa while the other always remains in contact with the boat. On occasion the RHIBS tow the boat alongside the Iuventa for direct embarkation.

Once on board, rescued persons receive medical attention and most importantly drinking water which is kept in large built-in tanks that can be refilled by generating potable water from sea water by means of a water-maker.  

Eventually larger NGO or Italian  coast-guard vessels transfer our rescued persons to safety ashore.

### Mission Von der Leyen

**THE SECOND MISSION 2017**

**We demand a state-run rescue mission, Frau von der Leyen!**  
Since the beginning of mission Sophia ships of the navy are chasing a phantom - smugglers on the Mediterranean.  
Instead of using the 42.3 million Euros to rescue people in maritime distress the navy's ships are not allowed to engage in active search and rescue. We are forced to take responsibility on sea in place of politicians instead!  
In 2015 Frau von der Leyen claimed to sent those ships on a mission of search and rescue near the territorial waters of Libya. A mandate to fight against smugglers is the only thing that's left of that promise. There is no appearence of the word 'rescue' in that mandate. For the next two weeks we'll make your words come true and carry out rescue missions.

### Mission De Maizière

![Mission De Maizière background](../f/images/new/mission_current.jpg)

**FIRST MISSION 2017**

As young Europeans we take over the job of political actors who actually should take responsibility on the grounds of European values. We cannot watch any longer how Europes responsibilities are neglected on the borders of a Fortress Europe.  
We are investing our time and energy unsalaried to stand for our vision of Europe. When people die at our borders there is only one thing we should do: rescue them.

We're asking ourselves: If we manage to buy a ship, to convert it and to organise a professional crew to save people in maritime distress - why are political decision makers not able to take over those tasks?

From now on we will dedicate our rescue missions to exactly those persons whose responsibilities we are taking over on the sea.  
This is why our first mission will be dedicated to **Thomas De Maizière**.
