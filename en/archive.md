#### **2018/04/24** Objection against seizure of IUVENTA rejected.

The First Criminal Section of the Cassation Court in Rome rejects 
objection to the seizure of IUVENTA by Jugend Rettet e.V. Despite the lack of evidence 
for the allegations against the organization and high death toll on the central 
Mediterranean route, the IUVENTA until further notice will not be able to operate.  
A more detailed explanation of the decision is currently pending.

#### **2018/04/23** Decision to release IUVENTA will be announced tomorrow morning.

The Cassation Court in Rome held this morning, but no decision has yet been announced. For our lawyers, it is clear that the allegations that have already been refuted by external experts do not meet the criteria for seizure of IUVENTA. By this evening, the judges will have made a decision. We will be informed of the outcome of the decision tomorrow morning.

#### **2018/04/18** Jugend Rettet IUVENTA started petition website #right2rescue

Following statement can be signed on [right2rescue.org](https://right2rescue.org/en/):
  
"Confiscated ships don't safe any lives. We demand the immediate release of the IUVENTA. I herewith support the humanitarian work of civil search-and-rescue NGOs."

#### **2018/04/17** Decision on the release of our IUVENTA on April 23rd in Rome

The decision on the release of our IUVENTA will take place on April 23rd in Rome.
973 people have died on the central Mediterranean route since the day of the, August 2nd.
No evidence against us, nor against individual crew members is available to date.
Various experts refuted the allegations of the Italian prosecutor.

If valid law will be spoken, then from April 23rd we can continue to do what we have been convinced of since the beginning: saving people from distress.

#### **2018/03/18** Ship of Proactiva Open Arms confiscated

As a matter of course state repressions against unpleasant NGOs are taking place in Europe: on  August 2nd 2017, the IUVENTA was confiscated by the Italian authorities. To date, there are no charges against the organization or individuals. On March 18th, 2018, the ship of Proactiva Open Arms was detained. Instead of relying on constructive solutions in migration policy based on existing law and humanitarian values, the EU is simply trying to close the Central Mediterranean route by all means. The fact that the European Contracting States thereby break with international and human rights agreements, by people being rejected to Libya, is apparently accepted as well as the European cooperation with criminal structures in Libya. Human rights are valid for all people, irrespective of their legal status - and the criminalization of the people who support these rights is an intolerable situation.

#### **Mar. 13th:** Case IUVENTA: Appointment at the Supreme Court of Cassation

On April 23rd the court in Rome will decide on the release of our Iuventa. On that day we will go into second instance against the seizure and demand the immediate return of our rescue ship. We are certain that the allegations of the public prosecutor's office lack any legal basis, that our crews have always adhered to applicable law and have worked in a highly professional manner and that they have done nothing wrong. Over the last few months, we have had the allegations repeatedly reviewed not only internally but also externally, and the interviewed experts agree with us on all points raised, which prove our innocence. That is why 8 months after the confiscation we are sure: The Iuventa must be released.  
In addition to the encouragement of international organizations and experts, we are especially encouraged by you!  
The confiscation as a legal instrument is a political measure. We will not accept that. We are not alone in our fight. Together with other organizations, we not only fight for our Iuventa, but also for a humane right of migration! We say: #freeiuventa! #RechtaufFlucht!

#### **Mar. 7th:** "Forensic Architecture" analysed the IUVENTA case

#### **Feb. 27th:** Sea rescue NGOs present Joint Statement in Brussels

The central Mediterranean route is still the most dangerous escape route in the world. Criminalization of rescues and escape do not provide any relief. In Brussels, we have now submitted a joint statement to the EU. What would speak against these points? Together with borderline europe -  Menschenrechte ohne Grenzen e.V., Watch The Med - Alarmphone, Sea-Watch, LIFELINE Salvamento Marítimo Humanitario and RESQSHIP we ask the EU: Are we the scapegoats of the failed EU policy?

#### **December 3rd-4th** Crew meeting in Berlin

Our crews were able to save 6.526 lives. We all met last weekend again to evaluate the missions and to optimize our processes. Our common goal is less deaths in the Mediterranean.


#### **December 1st** We do not want gifts

Dear EU, we have a Christmas wish: we want a state sea rescue program. We are pupils, trainees and students. We are simply young people. We want you to rescue people in maritime emergency on the Mediterranean. With numerous supporters we were able to rescue more than 6500 lives from drowning. We need any support, because you, dear EU, you will probably not fulfill our Christmas wish.  We do not want gifts. We want fewer deaths.


#### **November 29th** The IUVENTA reached her winter storage in Croatia

The IUVENTA reached her winter storage in Croatian. She'll get reconstructed again in February as we need a new crane and also new dinghies. Furthermore we want to use our crews' experience to adjust her for the rescues. With our colleagues of Rainbow for Africa we optimize our hospital for a more efficient medical care. Next spring she'll head for the Med again.


#### **November 23rd** 6.526 saved lives

With Mission Diversity our last mission for this year is over. We were able to accomplish seven missions in 2016. Thank you very, very much to everyone who was a part of our crews. You made our theoretical considerations come true and saved 6.526 lives. Furthermore we would like to say thank you to everyone who helped that the Iuventa is a rescue ship now: our numerous donors, everyone who helped during the resconstruction and also a big thank you to our ambassadors and ambassadresses who do not only make sure Jugend Rettet gets more and more popular, but also collected so many donations. From the first day on, Jugend Rettet was for everyone to participate and we're grateful and proud what we achieved together. THANK YOU!


#### **November 23rd** Mission Diversity done

Our crew of Mission Diversity is back safe and sound. Guys, thank you so much for your great effort and the rescue of 393 lives!

#### **November 17th** 100 people rescued

This morning the MRCC called our crew to an emergency situation with 100 people on a rubber boad. Despite severe weather conditions with 1.5 - 2 metre high waves, the rescue went well and everyone came on board safely. 


#### **November 15th** Tough rescue with many deaths

The Iuventa is currently together with the Maersk Erin in a difficult use - A rubber boat capsized. The 23 survivors are on board of the Maersk Erin. 100 people are missing. The crews are searching for survivors in the water and recovering dead bodies.
Our thoughts are with the victims and everyone involved of this catastrophe.


#### **November 14th** Ambassadors from Engstingen collect 3066,93€

Our two ambassadors for Engstingen, Aron and Jeremias, started their first big campaign at different schools last weekend. This brought together 3066,95€!  We're very proud of these two and grateful for anyone who donated so generously. Great Work!


#### **November 12th** 140 people rescued

140 people were rescued today. Among them two pregnants. Our medical team of R4A took care of them and further supplied several burns, one broken arm and a girl with fever. The Aquarius of SOS MEDITERRANEE took all of them on board. Furthermore our crew was a part of saving six rubber boats yesterday. More info to come.


#### **November 11th** Mission Diversity leaves Valletta

Our seventh and therefore last crew for this year left Valletta last night. The mission runs under the name Diversity. Cultural diversity mustn't be a reason for fear and origin must never be a reason for hate. Diversity doesn't take anything from us. To us diversity is the big gain for a society. Willingness to a diverse society is characterised by welcoming of people with open arms instead of defending borders. As different as we all may be, the ability to act human unites us all.


#### **November 10th** 2016 deadliest year for refugees on the Med

"More than 4.200 people have lost their lives in the Mediterranean this year or are missing. Already two months before the end of the year, 2016 is the year with most deaths in the Mediterranean. (...) Each and single one of these people have a story and a face. They escape wars, discrimination, violence and the lack of resources."
We demand the EU to overtake responsibility!

#### **November 10th** Andronikos' circumnavigation around the island of Lesbos ended

Yesterday Andronikos' circumnavigation around the island of Lesbos ended - for the moment. His autumn holidays are over and Andronikos has to return to school. He is, however, planning to complete the rest of his circumnavigation in his Christmas holidays. An exciting and successful week is over: he sailed from Molivos in the north of the island to the small village of Nifida on the Gulf of Kaloni in the south. One night Andronikos spent with young refugees in their quaters. His commitment and solidarity is admirable. Thank you, Andronikos!


#### **November 7th** Skipper Uli passes the commando to Kai

After four missions our Skipper Uli passes the IUVENTA over to our new Skipper Kai.
Thank you very, very much for your great engagement and perseverance, Uli!  All the best to Kai and thank you for your support!


#### **November 6th** Mission Dignity completed - 2733 people rescued

The mission was unbelievably demanding, mentally as physically, long stretches without any sleep, but yet with indescribable success. Within seven operating days we were able to save 2733 lives, of which we gave 1293 people protection on board of the IUVENTA, medical supply, water and food. Our medical team of Rainbow 4 Africa took care of bullet wounds, complicated fractures, heavily pregnants in critical condition and numerous - partly severe - combustions. Some cases of seasickness were successfully treated, too. Two female patients urgently had to get picked up by a helicopter of the Italian marine and were brought to a hospital on Malta. Again all boats were overloaded and therefore in a critical condition. The tubes of several boats collapsed due to too much weight. Luckily our RIB was always on-site to rescue the people quickly and safely. As it already happened during Mission Unity, the boats appeared at any day and night time, which lead to search and rescue even when it was pitch black. Together with our two RIBs we managed to find every boat and rescue everyone.
We can not say thank you enough to our crew of Mission Dignity. We're proud of you!


#### **November 4th** 840 people rescued

Since 2am our crew is in use again. An emergency call from the MRCC woke the crew to take their position. With many lookouts, our dinghy in the water and the help of the Bourbon Argos (MSF) we managed to discover the first boat and supplied everyone with life jackets. The Bourbon Argos took everyone on board. According to the people they started with two boats, so we continued the search for the second one. Almost simultaneously another call from the MRCC came in to tell us about another boat. It was sighted north of the 15nm zone and got supplied with life jackets, too. The Bourbon Argos took all of them on board again.  09:55am ... 6 rubber boats later. The Iuventa, Minden (LifeBoat), Bourbon Argos and Topaz Responder (MOAS) are still in use. The Iuventa took 140 people on board. All in all 840 were rescued within 8 hours. Right now our RIB is shuttling people from a rubber boat to Topaz Responder. The LCG is assisting them.


#### **November 3rd** Rescue of 420 people

UNHCR informs that 239 people are missing after the catastrophe between Libya and Italy yesterday evening. Today was a rough day as well. Our crew of „Mission Dignity“ assisted rescuing 420 people from maritime emergency. All passengers were brought to the Phoenix of MOAS safely.  Right now our crew is still busy with ongoing rescue missions. Catastrophes like the one that happened yesterday can be avoided: By safe and legal passages! We demand action from European governments and the civil society right now!


#### **October 29th** Refugee Rescue Solidarity Party in Berlin

Thank you, Tilman! <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/137691560025395/" target="_blank">More information</a>.


#### **October 28th** 15-year-old Greek starts charity circumnavigation

The 15-year-old Andronikus, so far the youngest supporter of Jugend Rettet e.V., will start a symbolic charity circumnavigation of his native island Lesbos on 28th October 2016 to draw attention to the dying on the Mediterranean. "With my circumnavigation I would like to help Jugend Rettet to proceed with their missions successfully, because every person in maritime emergency deserves rescue. Each of us can support this in his or her way through actions like this or through donations. Jugend Rettet shows this in a way that impressed me deeply and will be an example for me for a lifetime,“ Andronikos explains.


#### **October 27th** More rescues

The current situation on the Mediterranean can hardly be described. Not a day goes by without at least one rescue and our crew gets hardly any time to rest and recover from these strenuous missions. Due to extreme weather conditions the situation gets more and more dangerous for the fleeing, too.
Our crew took 169 people from a rubber and a wooden boat on board yesterday. One person could only be brought out of the rubber boat dead. Furthermore our team helped retrieving one more corpse out of the water.
Only 2h after finishing their use and the guests got handed over for their transport to the VOS Hestia, another emergency call reached our crew of Mission Dignity. Since this night the Iuventa is in use with again 280 between 300 guets on board. Among them two pregnant women, about to give birth.


#### **October 25th** Mission Dignity in continuous use

As soon as our crew of reached the SAR zone they were is in continuous use. Already on sunday an emergency call about two rubber boats reached the crew. Luckily both boats were stable. We distributed life jackets and took all 279 people on board. Unfortunately there were many dehydrated and exhausted people as well as persons with severe burns so that our medical team of Rainbow4Africa was very busy. Due to long discussions with the MRCC in Rome it took a while until we had a solution to transport the rescued. Only at five past ten in the evening the rescued got handed over to the Spanish coast guard. We wish everyone an onward journey.  Yesterday 268 people were taken on board and handed over to a Maltese warship shortly after midnight. Only 15 minutes later the next emergency call came in.  All the other NGOs are in continuous use, too. Unbelievable that private organizations have to do all this work.


#### **October 21st** Start of Mission Dignity

"Human dignity is inviolable" that's how it is written in Article 1 of the Constitution. It's hard to trust this sentence, while the European Union forces people to take such a dangerous rout like the one via the Mediterranean. This why we try to at least keep a little dignity alive by not letting them drown. We see it as our duty to support people on the run instead of turning away from them. To safe and respect the dignity of every single human also means to avoid shocking pictures of people in the water who fear for their lives.


#### **October 14th** Mission Unity finished

Welcome back to our amazing crew of Mission Unity! Thank you for your great effort and the rescue of 423 lives.


#### **October 14th** 148 people rescued

130 people were held by our crew of the current mission Unity from a rubber boat and another 18 from a wooden boat. Our crew supplied them with water, food and medicine. We wish them all the best for their future.


#### **October 12th** Rescue under difficult conditions

In the night of the 12th to 13th October our crew was part of rescuing 126 people. The rescue was not only because it was pitch black outside extremely difficult, but also due to high waves and strong wind. The weather pushed the rubber boat back into Libyan territorial waters. Yet there was not much time to think as MOAS drone showed that one tube already bursted and people slipped into the water. Together with Proactiva, Boat Refugee Foundation and MOAS our RIB shuttled the rescued to the Phoenix. 17 people, among them a four-year old could not get rescued.


#### **October 7th** Rescue of 132 people

132 people were saved from a robber boat - among them a family with four kids, who were extremely happy about their new cuddly toys.



#### **October 5th** Rescue of 30 people


30 people, who were on a wooden boat, were rescued by our crew of Mission Unity 50nm off the Libyan coast. The people were already at sea for two days. At some point the motor broke. Everyone was taken on board of the Iuventa, where they also spent the night until they were handed over to the Italian coast guard. 



#### **October 4th** Start of Mission Unity


As part of the the Day of Reunification of Germany, we want it to point out that borders - if they are in the heads of people or on maps - can never justify that people have to fear for their lives. As a group of young Europeans we trust in the power of a unified European commitment. We need to hold on to our democratic and humanitarian values which are unfortunately at the moment too often discussed and questioned.



#### **October 4th** Photos of Mission Humanity

Aliyah can't take anymore: Escape from Somalia. Through the Sahara. Lampedusa. Homeless  Aliyah ist am Ende ihrer Kräfte: Flucht aus Somalia. Durch die Sahara. Lampedusa. Without shelter and defence she was exposed to violence and abuse on the streets of Catania. - She could not bear that again.
