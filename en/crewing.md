You'd like to carry out rescue mission on the Mediterranean as a crew member?

The IUVENTA is patrolling near the Libyan coast. We need your help to carry out the planned missions successfully!

We're looking for people with experience in their field, who are conscious of the risks of rescue missions. Ask yourself: Are you willing to take the tasks involved? We need to choose our crew members carefully, so that they meet the special demands of our rescue missions.

You can find the application form here: **[/crew](/crew)**

In case of questions please contact our crewing team at **[crew@jugendrettet.org](mailto:crew@jugendrettet.org)**.

## GENERAL REQUIREMENTS ON CREW MEMBERS

* Regardless of their position within the team, crew members will interact appropriately and compromise where necessary in order to maintain positive and safe team dynamics.
* All crew members are encouraged and required to question and challenge their own performance in order to continuously improve their performance both individually and as a team during operations.
* Acute stressors can impact on individuals as well as the team, potentially impeding on performance levels. In order to not compromise operational safety, individual crew members are required to reflect on personal stress levels, identify ways of dealing with stress and seek support if necessary.
* Since the crews are usually composed of people from various countries, a good English proficiency is required in order to communicate effectively within the crew. Also the communication with the other organisations is done in English.
* For all crew members it is essential to work well in a team environment.
