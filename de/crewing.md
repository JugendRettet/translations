Du willst als Crewmitglied die Rettung auf dem Mittelmeer durchführen?

Ab März wird die Iuventa wieder vor der libyschen Küste im Einsatz sein. Um die geplanten Missionen auch wirklich erfolgreich durchführen zu können, brauchen wir Deine Hilfe!

Wir suchen Menschen mit Berufserfahrung, die sich über das hohe Risiko der Rettungsaktionen bewusst sind. Bitte frage dich selbst, ob du dir die Situation zutraust. Aufgrund der besonderen Anforderungen sind wir gezwungen die Crew sehr sorgsam auszuwählen.

Unser Bewerbungsformular findest Du unter folgendem Link: [/crew](/crew)

Bei Fragen steht Dir unser Crewing-Department gerne unter [crew@jugendrettet.org](mailto:crew@jugendrettet.org) zur Verfügung.

Da aufgrund der internationalen Zusammensetzung der Crew und des Charakters des Einsatzes Englisch unsere Bordsprache ist, findest Du die Informationen zu den verschiedenen Positionen direkt auf Englisch.

## GENERAL REQUIREMENTS ON CREW MEMBERS

* Regardless of their position within the team, crew members will interact appropriately and compromise where necessary in order to maintain positive and safe team dynamics.
* All crew members are encouraged and required to question and challenge their own performance in order to continuously improve their performance both individually and as a team during operations.
* Acute stressors can impact on individuals as well as the team, potentially impeding on performance levels. In order to not compromise operational safety, individual crew members are required to reflect on personal stress levels, identify ways of dealing with stress and seek support if necessary.
* Since the crews are usually composed of people from various countries, a good English proficiency is required in order to communicate effectively within the crew. Also the communication with the other organisations is done in English.
* For all crew members it is essential to work well in a team environment.
